The extraordinary success of the market is illustrated by the commercial property investment figure for 2018, with the value of transactions reaching a record high of €7.2bn. The first quarter of 2019 indicates continued strong interest in investing in Poland. What is more, our practice and market data show the group of active investors has grown since last year.\n",
